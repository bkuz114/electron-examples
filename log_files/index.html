    <title>Basic Electron App</title>
</head>

<body>
    This is a basic electron example that shows how to save javascript console output from the app into logfiles.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Creates a new timestampped directory each app run. (Root log dir is 'logs' in same dir as main.js; it will get created on the first run of this app.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Separate log files are genearted for the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model#the-main-process" target="_blank">main</a> and <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model#the-renderer-process" target="_blank">renderer processes</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model#the-main-process" target="_blank">Main process</a></b>: nodejs environment that manages the app (in this example, main.js)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model#the-renderer-process" target="_blank">Renderer process</a></b>: process for rendering web content (in this example, examplejs.js) <i>Note: electron spawns an individual renderer process for each BrowserWindow you create; in this example, just using a single renderer process and logfile.</i>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

            Log level is set to <i>error</i> so that only console.error output is written; this can be changed in `main.js` (Note to self: this is only having an impact on main process logs; renderer are still printing to default level; I think electron cmd switches I need to figure out).
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses lightweight npm package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-log" target="_blank">electron-log</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses console statements just like normal; you won't need to change any existing console statements in your project. It simply maps those statements to the electron-log instance, by one line of code in main.js
        </li>
        <li>
            Console output still appears on your cmd where you are running npm start
        </li>
        <li>
            This example can be extended to be used in production apps packaged by <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager" target="_blank">electron-packager</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Hope this helps someone.
